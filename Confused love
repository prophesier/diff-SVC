I wanna change, but don't know how to start
I wanna rest, but my mind is torn apart
Life is unpredictable, we all make mistakes
Regret lingers on, the pain it creates

Things I did, things I didn't do
Haunt me still, like a nightmare that's true
I don't wanna repeat the same old crap
That ruins my present, and all that's left is scrap


I wanna change but don't know how
I wanna rest but don't know how
Sorry mom for letting you down
Actions that hurt, still spinning around


I miss my dad, the pain never fades
Sometimes it hits hard, and I'm left in shades
Devils on my back, and I can't break free
The cage is locked, but the monsters can see

The cage opens up, when I'm feeling alive
The happiness fades, and I'm left with strife
I don't wanna walk down my father's path
You told me that, and I can't forget that


I wanna change but don't know how
I wanna rest but don't know how
Sorry mom for letting you down
Actions that hurt, still spinning around


I ask God, why did you take him away?
I know it's not right, but I still pray
I feel like he's not listening to me
I lost my faith, and it's hard to believe

Satan comes back, and I feel his wrath
I promised you, I wouldn't cry for him in the past
But it's hard to accept, that he's gone forever
I won't see him again, and it feels like never


I wanna change but don't know how
I wanna rest but don't know how
Sorry mom for letting you down
Actions that hurt, still spinning around


I'm sorry mom, for causing you pain
I'll try to be better, and not make the same mistakes again
It's hard to move on, but I'll try my best
I'll keep pushing forward, and leave the past to rest.
