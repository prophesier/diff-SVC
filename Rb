I'm tired of living life so plain

Being normal's driving me insane

I need some sparkle, I need some flash

To break away from this boring ash

Pre-Chorus:

I wanna live, I wanna shine

To be different, to be divine

But everyone tells me to stay in line

To be average, to be just fine

Chorus:

'Cause being normal is so dull

I wanna stand out, wanna be bold

To be the one that they behold

Being normal's getting old

I'm tired of following all the rules

I need to break away from these schools

I wanna be free, I wanna be brave

To be the one that everyone craves

I wanna live, I wanna shine

To be different, to be divine

But everyone tells me to stay in line

To be average, to be just fine

'Cause being normal is so dull

I wanna stand out, wanna be bold

To be the one that they behold

Being normal's getting old

I'll paint my hair, I'll wear bright clothes

I'll dance till morning, till nobody knows

I'll be myself, no mask to wear

To be different is my only care

'Cause being normal is so dull

I wanna stand out, wanna be bold

To be the one that they behold

Being normal's getting old

Being normal is so boring

I wanna be myself, that's the thing

I'll break the mold, I'll be unique

Being normal's just not for me.
